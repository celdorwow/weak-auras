# Descritpion

Yet, another weak auras for a Feral. My intention was only to keep track of DoTs, proc like Incarnation, cooldowns and see when things can be refreshed. I couldn't find anything that would help me to track everything I needed so I decided to create my own set of auras. It is heavy and for some reasons when I select the whole group, WoW freezes but if I leave WA config window, everything's working as exopected.

## Explanation

Auras get two kind of glow:

* light Autocast Shrine (AS) or
* strong Action Button Glow (ABG) to track different things.

Auars also get desaturated if spell is not known; for instance talent is not selected. Auras also get dimmed if a spell is not usable, for instance if there is not any combo points in order for Rip to work.

Auras display two kind of counters: when de/buff is active and when a spell is on cooldown. The former is indicated by shrinking bright part of an icon whilst the latter is indicated other way round.

## List of auras

### **Tiger's Fury**

The aura tracks a counter when buff is active and cooldown when the spell is not ready. It also indicates most efficient way to apply TF: it gets strong glow if it is ready and the energy is below 50%.

With Predator talent, it has less importance.

### Fericious Bite

Highest damage is on maximum 5 CPs with some energy stored. This is indicated by a strong glow on the Fericious Bite.

Depending on Incarnation: King of Jungle proc, it is either minimum of 30% with Incarnation buff or 50% without the buff, respectively.

### **Shred** and **Thrash**

Get strong glow if Clearcasting procs. As a DoT, light glow also indicates Thrash can be refreshed on pandemic time without losing previously active DoT.

### **Rip** and **Rake** (including **Savage Roar**)

Similarly to Thrash, Rip and Rake (and Savage Roar as a buff) get light glow on pandemic time. This occurs when a DoT or buff is still active but a spell can be refreshed without losing curent damage or buff. DoTs are tracked on a target.

If target is not seleceted, the glow disappears. Also, glows also disappear if a player is not in catform, is not in combat, or hasn't got a valid target with active debuffs.

### **Brutal Stash**

Shows stacks and gets dimmed if is not usable. BS does not glow when the buff procs.

Although BS energy is reduced by 100%, it is not recommended to use BS when Clearcasting procs as energy consumption is too small. Instead, Shred is a better usage on Clearcasting.

### **Regrowth**

Regrowth gets strong glow if Predatory Swiftness is active, that is when it gets an instant cast. The light glow indicates a player already has an active buff but another instant cast is available.

### **Incarnation: King of Jungle**

This icon tracks both cooldown when the spell is not ready and expiration time when it is active.

### Other spells

There are other spells with simple auras which only track cooldowns of some spells.
