This aura shows informative text regarding potions in the Horrific Visions. The links to Wowhead explains it in details.

Feature:

* Info about all colours once the bad potion is identified
* Display progress each buff

Aura is activated when a players enters a scenario. Once the bad potion is identified, just type its colour in chat windows but make sure it is one of the channels: say, party, or instance.    

[TL;DR]
Once the colour of a bad potion is identified, it is fairly easy to deduce a colour of the "good" potion, which adds 100 sanity. The aura simply displays an informative text about colour of good and bad potions. Other potions such as Heal, an AoE damage and a damage reduction are in progress. While inside the Horrific Vision, the aura requires to type one of the 5 colour of a bad potion : "black", "blue", "green", "purple", or "red".
